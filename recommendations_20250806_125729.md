# Trading Recommendations for MANKIND PHARMA

## Intraday Setup

Based on the current price and market structure, here are the immediate intraday trading recommendations:

- **Entry Point:** Wait for the price to reach the S1 support level at ₹2555.73. As the historical analysis shows a 100% success rate of support bounce in an uptrend, this could be a good buying opportunity.

- **Stop Loss:** A suggested stop loss could be around ₹2530 (1% below the support level S1). This should help limit any potential losses if the market turns against the position.

- **Profit Target:** Aim for a profit target around ₹2650 to ₹2670, which is approximately 1.5% to 2% above the entry point. This target is realistic considering the neutral trend strength and historical pattern analysis.

## Swing Trading Opportunities 

For swing trading over the next 2-4 days:

- **Entry Point:** A break above ₹2650 could signal a short-term bullish trend. This could serve as an entry point for a swing trade.

- **Stop Loss:** Set a stop loss at around ₹2600, which is 2% below the potential entry point.

- **Profit Target:** Aim for a profit target around ₹2750 - ₹2800, which is 3-5% above the potential entry point.

## Risk Management Guidelines

- **Position size:** Do not risk more than 1-2% of your trading capital on any single trade. Adjust your position size accordingly.

- **Risk-Reward ratio:** Aim for a risk-reward ratio of at least 1:3. This means for every unit of risk you are taking, you should aim to make three units in return.

## Key Levels to Watch

- **Resistance Levels:** Since there are no well-defined resistance levels, watch for psychological resistance around round numbers like ₹2700 and ₹2800.

- **Support Levels:** Keep an eye on the S1 level at ₹2555.73. If the price falls below this level and stays there, it could signal a potential downtrend.

## Action Items for Traders

- Monitor the stock price closely for a bounce at the support S1 level for a potential intraday trade.
- Watch for a break above ₹2650 for a potential swing trade.
- Always set appropriate stop losses to manage your downside risk.
- Follow the risk management guidelines to ensure your trading capital is protected.
